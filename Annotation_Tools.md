1. Introduction of semantic image segmentation annotation service: Anolytics(maybe not free) https://medium.com/anolytics/how-to-use-semantic-image-segmentation-annotation-for-medical-imaging-datasets-dba536b018df

Official website of Anolytics: https://www.anolytics.ai/solutions/healthcare/ (this service may be paid)

2. VGG Image Annotator (free) http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/ (online open annotation tool, may not be suitable for segmentation annotation)

3. LabelMe (free) http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/Release3.0/

LabelMe Instruction: https://awkvect.com/data-annotation-tool-analysis-how-to-use-labelme/

4. RectLabel (Mac App Store, One-time payment): https://rectlabel.com/

5. Labelbox https://labelbox.com/

- Recommendation: LabelMe because it's free and suitable for segmentation annotation
