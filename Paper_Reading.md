Traditional atlas-based anatomy segmentation methods is difficult to handle anatomy variations among patients. Missing annotation problem: masked and weighted loss function, too much downsampling may have a negative impact on small anomalies, hybrid loss(dice loss + focal loss, the dice loss learns the class distribution alleviating the imbalanced voxel problem, where as the focal loss forces the model to learn poorly classified voxels better, modified hybrid loss to handle missing annotations problem), the U-Net with one downsampling layer works better on small organ segmentation than the standard U-Net probably because downsampling reduces image resolution and makes it harder to segment small organs.

16. 2017, Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks(ResNeXt), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05431.pdf ,a new dimension: cardinality(the size of the set of transformations, in my words, it is the number of single blocks in Inception blocks), even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity.

17. 2018, Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf ,two-stage object detectors(R-CNN): generates a sparse set of candidate object locations + classifies each candidate location as one of the foreground classes or as background using a convolutional neural network, one-stage detectors(YOLO, SSD). Intuitively, this scaling factor can automatically down-weight the contribution of easy examples during training and rapidly focus the model on hard examples. A simple one-stage object detector: RetinaNet —> dense sampling of object locations in an input image & feature pyramid & anchor boxes, class imbalance and model initialization: a “prior” for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class(foreground) at the start of training, class imbalance and two-stage detectors: first cascade stage is an object proposal mechanism that reduces the nearly infinite set of possible object locations down to one or two thousand and biased mini batch sampling. RetinaNet: ResNet backbone + Feature Pyramid Network(FPN) + two branch subnets(classifying anchor boxes + regressing bounding boxes). 

18. 2017, Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144.pdf ,Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. A top down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. an architecture that combines low-resolution, semantically strong features with high-resolution, semantically weak features via a top-down pathway and lateral connections(merged by addition). A feature pyramid that has rich semantics at all levels and is built quickly from a single input image scale. Append a 3*3 convolution on each merged map to generate the final feature map, which is to reduce the aliasing effect of upsampling. 

19. 2020 CVPR, CascadePSP: Toward Class-Agnostic and Very High-Resolution Segmentation via Global and Local Refinement, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02551.pdf ,a novel approach to address the high-resolution segmentation problem without using any high-resolution training data. A general segmentation refinement framework for refining any input segmentations and achieve a higher accuracy without any fine-tuning afterward.  CascadePSP performs high-resolution(up to 4K) segmentation refinement even our model has never seen any high-resolution training images. With a single refinement module trained on low-resolution data without any fine-tuning, the proposed Global step refines the entire image and provides sufficient image context for the subsequent Local step to perform full-resolution high-quality refinement. CascadePSP is a general segmentation refinement model that refines any given segmentation from low to high resolution. CascadePSP a general cascade segmentation refinement model that can refine any given input segmentations, boosting the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models without fine-tuning. The Global step considers the whole resized image to repair structure while the Local step refines details in full resolution using image crops. While the Global step is sufficient for low-resolution inputs, the Local step is crucial for accurate high-resolution refinement with size higher than the switching point 900. The lack of a high-resolution image segmentation dataset is one of the difficulties of evaluating an image segmentation model in high-resolution —> BIG dataset is introduced. Scene parsing: divide-and-conquer approach: independently refine each semantic object using our pertained network, followed by integrating the results using a fusion function. Naive approach would be to use argmax on the output confidence which would lead to noisy results in regions where all the classes have low scores. Instead, out fusion function is a modified argmax where if all the input class confidence have values lower than 0.5, we fall back to the original segmentation. 

20. 2019 DARTS: DENSEUNET-BASED AUTOMATIC RAPID TOOL FOR BRAIN SEGMENTATION, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05567.pdf ,GitHub: https://github.com/NYUMedML/DARTS ,weighted loss function: weighing each ROI in inverse proportionality to its average size to address the extreme class imbalance. DenseUNet: dense convolution + UNet. Freesurfer(current tools for brain segmentation) is based on topological surface mappings to detect gray/white matter boundaries followed by nonlinear atlas registration and nonlinear spherical surface registration for each sub-cortical segment —> computationally intensive. Based on our empirical observation, the network trained with only weighted dice loss was unable to escape local optimum and did not converge. Also, empirically it was seen that the stability of the model, in terms of convergence, decreased as the number of classes and class imbalance increased. We found that weighted cross-entropy loss, on the other hand, did not get stuck in any local optima and learned reasonably good segmentations. As the model’s performance with regard to dice score flattened out, we switched from weighted cross entropy to weighted dice loss.Dice loss penalizes both over prediction(especially) and under prediction and, hence, is well-suited for segmentation tasks such as the one proposed here and is particularly useful in medical imaging. Overall dice scores for smaller regions tend to be lower than the dice scores for larger regions.

23. ECCV 2020, SegFix: Model-Agnostic Boundary Refinement for Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04269.pdf , a model-agnostic post-processing scheme to improve the boundary quality for the segmentation result that is generated by any existing segmentation model. SegFix consistently reduces the boundary errors for segmentation results. The number of error pixels significantly decrease with larger distances to the boundary, predictions of the interior pixels are more reliable. Reduce boundary errors by replacing labels of boundary pixels with the labels of corresponding interior pixels for a segmentation result(The first step aims to localize the pixels along the object boundaries. We follow the contour detection methods and simply use a convolutional network to predict a binary mask indicating the boundary pixels. In the second step, we learn a direction away from the boundary pixel to an interior pixel and identify the corresponding interior pixel by moving from the boundary pixel along the direction by a certain distance). We only need to train a single unified SegFix model once without any further fine-tuning the different segmentation models(across multiple different datasets). Illustrating the SegFix framework: in the training stage, we first send the input image into a backbone to predict a feature map, then we apply a boundary branch to predict a binary boundary map and a direction branch to predict a direction map and mask it with the binary boundary map, we apply boundary loss and direction loss on the predicted boundary map and direction map separately, in the testing stage, we first convert the direction map to offset map and then refine the segmentation results of any existing methods according to the offset map. 

24. 2019, Devil is in the Edges: Learning Semantic Boundaries from Noisy Annotations, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07934.pdf ,aim to learn sharp and precise semantic boundaries by explicitly reasoning about annotation noise during training.

25. 2017, Improved Regularization of Convolutional Neural Networks with Cutout, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04552.pdf ,cutout: regularization technique, randomly masking out square regions of input during training. Initially developed cutout as a targeted approach that specifically removed important visual features from the input of the image, this approach was similar to max-drop, in that we aimed to remove maximally activated features in order to encourage the network to consider less prominent features. Targeted coutout method performed well, but randomly removing regions of a fixed size performed just as well as the targeted approach, without requiring any manipulation of the feature maps. The size of the cutout region is an important hyper-parameter.

33. 2019, EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf
systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance.
use neural architecture search(NAS) to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets.
proposed compound scaling method that uniformly scales all three dimensions with a fixed ratio.
the compound scaling method makes sense because if the input image is bigger, then the network needs more layers to increase the receptive field and more channels to capture more fine-grained patterns on the bigger image.
the effectiveness of model scaling heavily depends on the baseline network; use neural architecture search(NAS) to develop a new baseline network, and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets.
Empirically observe that diferent scaling dimensions are not independent. Intuitively, for higher resolution images, we should increase network depth, such that the larger receptive fields can help capture similar features that include more pixels in bigger images. Correspondingly, we should also increase network width when resolution is higher, in order to capture more fine-grained patterns with more pixels in high resolution images. These intuitions suggest that we need to coordinate and balance different scaling dimensions rather than conventional single-dimension scaling.

34. 2019 CVPR, DFANet: Deep Feature Aggregation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation, https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Li_DFANet_Deep_Feature_Aggregation_for_Real-Time_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf ,our proposed network starts from a single lightweight backbone and aggregates discriminative features through sub-network and sub-stage cascade respectively, drawbacks of some real-time semantic segmentation approaches(restrict input image size, pruning redundant channels —> lose the spatial details around boundaries and small objects. Shallow network weakens feature discriminative ability). Adopt a lightweight backbone model(rather than ResNet, Xception and DenseNet backbone) and investigate how to improve the segmentation performance with limited computation. The high-level context is lacking in incorporation with the former level features which also retain the spatial detail and semantic information in the network path, in order to enhance the model learning capacity and increase the receptive field simultaneously, feature reuse is an immediate thought. Deep Feature Aggregation Network(DFANet) contains three parts: the lightweight backbones, sub-network aggregation and sub-stage aggregation modules. Because depth-wise separable convolution is proved to be one of the most efficient operation in real-time inference, we modify the Xception network as the backbone structure. In pursuit of better accuracy, we append a fully-connected attention module in the tail of the backbone to reserve the maximum receptive field. Sub-network aggregation focuses on upsampling the high-level feature maps of the previous backbone to the input of the next backbone to refine the prediction result. From another perspective, sub-network aggregation can be seen as a coarse-to-fine process for pixel classification. Sub-stage aggregation assembles feature representation between corresponding stages through “coarse” part and “fine” part. It delivers the receptive field and and high dimension structure details by combining the layers with the same dimension. After these three modules, a slight decoder composed of convolution and bilinear upsampling operations is adopted to combine the outputs of each stage to generate the coarse-to-fine segmentation results. Deep feature aggregation to tackle real-time semantic segmentation on high resolution image.

35. IEEE 2020, Contextual Attention Refinement Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9040632 ,learns an attention vector to guide the fusion of low-level and high-level features for obtaining higher segmentation accuracy. Various strategies can be used to generate more accurate segmentation results, e.g. designing a dilated convolution, combining features at different levels, and employing a multi-scale context aggregation strategy. Achieving a balance between accuracy and speed is critical for the semantic segmentation task in many real-time applications. Features learned from deeper layers contain relatively more semantic information.

37. 2016, ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02147.pdf ,ENet(Efficient Neural Network), SegNet saves indices of elements chosen in max pooling layers. Early downsampling: early stages of the network, which are often the most expensive by far. 

38. 2016, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf ,the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling(improves boundary delineation). 

39. 2017, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01105.pdf ,incorporate suitable global features, the local and global clues together make the final prediction more reliable. Global average pooling is a good baseline model as the global contextual prior, which is a commonly used in image classification tasks. 

40. CVPR 2018, ESPNet: Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06815 ,efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power. Under the same constraints on memory and computation, ESPNet outperforms all the current efficient CNN networks such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ENet on both standard metrics and newly introduced performance metrics that measure efficient on edge devices. The point-wise convolutions help in reducing the computation, while the spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions re-samples the feature maps to learn the representations from large effective receptive field. Convolutional factorization decomposes the convolutional operation into multiple steps to reduce the computational complexity. ESPNet first learns the encoder and then attaches a light-weight decoder to produce the segmentation mask. The ASP(Atrous spatial pyramid) module involves branching with each branch learning kernel at a different receptive field(using dilated convolutions). Though ASP modules tend to perform well in segmentation tasks due to their high effective receptive fields, ASP modules have high memory requirements and learn many more parameters. 

41. 2017, ERFNet: Efficient Residual Factorized ConvNet for Real-time Semantic Segmentation, http://www.robesafe.es/personal/eduardo.romera/pdfs/Romera17tits.pdf ,the core of our architecture is a novel layer that uses residual connections and factorized convolutions in order to remain efficient while retaining remarkable accuracy.  Similar paper with same authors: 2017, Efficient ConvNet for Real-time Semantic Segmentation, http://www.robesafe.uah.es/personal/eduardo.romera/pdfs/Romera17iv.pdf

42. 2017 CVPR, RefineNet: Multi-Path Refinement Networks for High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06612.pdf ,RefineNet exploits various levels of detail at different stages of convolutions and fuses them to obtain a high-resolution prediction without the need to maintain large intermediate feature maps.High-level semantic features helps the category recognition of image regions, while low-level visual features help to generate sharp, detailed boundaries for high-resolution prediction. Chained residual pooling is able to capture background context from a large image region, it does so by effectively pooling features with multiple window sizes and fusing them together with residual connections and learnable weights.

43. 2018, Light-Weight RefineNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03272.pdf ,replace 3*3 convolution with 1*1 convolution: receptive size issue, the skip-design structure of RefineNet, where low-level features are being summed up with the high-level ones and keeping chained residual pooling(CRP) blocks that are responsible for gathering contextual information. The CRP block tends to enlarge empirical receptive field(ERF), while the summation with the lower layer features further produces significantly larger activation contours. According to the ablation experiments, CRP is the main driving force behind accurate segmentation and classification, while the RCU(Residual Conv Unit) block improves the results just marginally(So this RCU block can be removed). This paper rethink an existing semantic segmentation architecture into the one suitable for real-time performance, while keeping the performance levels mostly intact.

44. 2018, ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08545.pdf ,based on PSPNet, image cascade network(ICNet) that incorporates multi-resolution branches under proper label guidance to address this challenge. Cascade feature fusion unit and cascade label guidance strategy are proposed to integrate medium and high resolution features, which refine the coarse semantic map gradually. Only the lowest-resolution input is fed into the heavy CNN with much reduced computation to get the coarse semantic prediction, the higher-resolution inputs are designed to recover and refine the prediction progressively regarding blurred boundaries and missing details. ICNet achieves high-efficiency inference with reasonable-quality segmentation results.

45. 2016, Speeding up Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving(SQNet), https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1uHiFyyg ,ELU has a mean activation of 0, thereby avoiding any bias shift effect: in ReLU networks, units will typically have a non-zero mean activation, thus they will act as additional bias unit for units in the next layer. By enabling units to have zero mean, this bias shift effect is reduced, which makes it easier for units to focus solely on actual information processing. This could otherwise only be achieved by using batch normalization, which would increase the computational cost of the network by adding specific layers to perform this operation.

47. 2018, BiSeNet: Bilateral Segmentation Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00897.pdf ,design a spatial path with a small stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution features, a context path with a fast downsampling strategy is employed to obtain sufficient receptive field, a new feature fusion module to combine features efficiently. For spatial path, we stack only three convolution layers to obtain the 1/8 feature map, which retains affluent spatial details. In respect of context path, we append a global average pooling layer on the tail of Xception, where the receptive field is the maximum of the backbone network. The output feature of spatial path is low level, while the output feature of context path is high level, therefore, we propose a specific feature fusion module to fuse these features.

The performance of our method heavily depends on two factors: one for the amount of weak labels and their semantic extent of class connotation and another for the domain gap between strongly and weakly labeled datasets. Image level + boundary level + pixel level: image level for class attention, and then use boundary level for boundary attention, and then pixel level segmentation.

49. 2019, A DEEP GRADIENT BOOSTING NETWORK FOR OPTIC DISC AND CUP SEGMENTATION, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01648.pdf ,To make use of spatial details and contain rich semantic information, making predictions on multiple levels of features, the final outputs are obtained by element-wise summation. In multiple prediction branches design, these branches are independent, which limits the learning capacity of the segmentation model. Our BoostNet is designed for pixel-level classification which treats the inner sub-networks as weaker learners while BoostCNN is proposed for image-level classification which treats the classification models after different training iterations or trained with different inputs as weaker learners.

52. Top 10 BraTS2020 challenge solution: Brain tumor segmentationwith self-ensembled, deeply-supervised 3D-Unet like neural networks. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01045.pdf ,The Hausdorff distance is complimentary to the Dice metric, as it measures the maximal distance between the margin of each set. It penalizes greatly outliers, as a prediction could exhibit almost voxel-perfect overlap, but if a single voxel is far away from the reference segmentation, the Hausdorff distance will be high. Group normalization and Instance normalization were used as a replacement for Batch Normalization due to a small batch size during training and good theoretical performance on non-medical datasets. Previous winner of the BraTS challenge limited their downsampling steps to 3, we hypothesized that further downsampling of the feature maps, given the limited size of the input(128*128*128), would lead to irreversible loss of spatial information. As the last stage of the encoder tasks much less GPU memory than the first, the dilation trick was used to perform a pseudo fifth stage at the same spatial resolution as the fourth stage. Deep supervision was performed after the dilated convolutions of the bottom of the network, and after each stage of the decoder(except the last), deep supervision was achieved by adding an extra 1*1*1 convolution with sigmoid activation and trilinear upsampling, the final loss is the unweighted sum of the main output and the three auxiliary losses. The saved weights were averaged, effectively creating a new "self-ensembled" model, we expected this method to produce a more generalizable model.

53. 2019, Two-Stage Cascaded U-Net: 1st Place Solution to BraTS Challenge 2019 Segmentation Task, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341488149_Two-Stage_Cascaded_U-Net_1st_Place_Solution_to_BraTS_Challenge_2019_Segmentation_Task ,In the first stage, we use a variant of U-Net as the first stage network to train a coarse prediction, in the second stage, we increase the width of the network and use two decoders so as to boost performance. The coarse segmentation map is fed together with the raw images into the second stage U-Net. Due to GPU memory limitations, our networks is designed to take input patches of size 128*128*128 voxels and to use a batch size of one, the network architecture consists of a larger encoding path, to extract complex semantic features, and a smaller decoding path, to recover a segmentation map with the same input size. Only use a dropout with a rate of 0.2 after the initial encoder convolution. In the second stage, the structure of the two decoders is the same except that one uses a deconvolution and the other uses trilinear interpolation, the interpolation decoder is used only druing training, because the performance of the decoder used deconvolution is better than used trilinear interpolation and add a decoder used trilinear interpolation to regularize the shared encoder can improve the performance in our experiment. Soft Dice loss. Since the MRI intensity values are non-standardized, we apply intensity normalization to each MRI modality from each patient independently by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the brain region only. Gradient checkpointing by PyTorch to reduce the memory consumption. To obtain a more robust prediction, we preserve eight weights of the model in the last time of the training progress for prediction and finally we average the output of the resulting eight segmentation probability maps.


54. 2018, 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation usingautoencoder regularization, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11654.pdf ,Due to a limited training dataset size, a variational auto-encoder branch is added to reconstruct the input image itself in order to regularize the shared decoder and impose additional constraints on its layers. We follow the encoder-decoder structure of CNN, with asymmetrically large encoder to extract deep image features, and the decoder part reconstructs dense segmentation masks, we also add the variational autoencoder(VAE) branch to the network to reconstruct the input images jointly with segmentation in order to regularize the shared encoder, at inference time, only the main segmentation encoder-decoder part is used. Group Normalization shows better than BatchNorm performance when batch size is small(batch size of 1 in this case). We use the spatial dropout with a rate of 0.2 after the initial encoder convolution, we have experimented with other placements of the dropout(including placing dropout layer after each convolution), but did not find any additional accuracy improvements.

58. 2020, KiU-Net: Towards Accurate Segmentation ofBiomedical Images using Over-completeRepresentations, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04878.pdf ,In studies, we observe that there is a considerable performance drop in the case of detecting smaller anatomical structures with blurred noisy boundaries. Address this issue by proposing an over-complete architecture(Ki-Net) which involves projecting the data onto higher dimensions(in the spatial sense). In the case of standard U-Net, even with skip connections, the smallest receptive field is limited by that of the first layer, hence, under-complete architectures are essentially limited in their abilities to capture finer details. In summary, this paper(1)explores over-complete deep networks(Ki-Net) for the task of segmentation(2)Propose a novel architecture(KiU-Net) combining the features of both under-complete and over-complete deep networks which captures finer details better than the standard encoder-decoder architecuture of U-Net thus aiding in precise segmentation, and(3)achieves faster convergence and better performance metrics than recent methods for segmentation. Propose a cross residual fusion block(CRFB), this block extracts complementary features from both network branches and forwards to both of them respectively.
