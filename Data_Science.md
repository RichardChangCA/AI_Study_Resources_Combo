Outliers: Z-score, Interquartile Range Score(IQR), DBSCAN. feature scaling(reduce the dominance of some features in some distance-based algorithms).  Encoding: Label(with order), one-hot, binary encoding(ordinal, help to calculate similarity between values). Dimensionality reduction(due to curse dimensionality and computating time): PCA(unsupervised), LDA(supervised). Difference between normalization and standardization: Normalization: is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Standardization: re-scales a feature value so that it has distribution with 0 mean value and variance equals to 1.

Select columns using make_column_selector with make_columns_transformer. Use Pipeline, Pipeline chains together multiple preprocessing steps, the output of each step is used as input to the next step, is makes it easy to apply the same preprocessing to train and test. Use grid search in the entire pipeline to find optimal tuning parameters. During using train_test_split for imbalanced dataset, be sure to set stratify=y so that class proportions are preserved when splitting. Write own function to do feature engineering in the pipeline.
