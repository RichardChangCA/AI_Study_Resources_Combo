6. Paper 2019, Modeling and predicting fecal coliform bacteria levels in oyster harvest waters along Louisiana Gulf coast, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19300135 ,It was found that the prevalence of fecal coliform bacteria in oyster growing waters was controlled by six independent environmental predictors, including wind, salinity, tide, water temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation, which were utilized as the model input variables. It was also found that the prevalence of fecal coliform bacteria in oyster growing waters is affected by not only current conditions of the six independent environmental variables but also antecedent conditions of the variables (particularly average solar radiation and cumulative rainfall over the past two days). Regression Task.

7. Paper 2021, The modified SWAT model for predicting fecal coliforms in the Wachusett Reservoir Watershed, USA, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22784807/ ,The result of sensitivity analysis demonstrates that solar radiation(solar radiation intensity) is one of the most significant fate factors of fecal coliform. The contribution of wildlife in the forest area could be significant for the fecal contamination in this watershed. Fecal coliform concentration downstream is greater than those upstream, which might be related to significant beaver population downstream of the Stillwater basin. Some sensitive factor: land use(forest), flow, sediment, solar radiation intensity. 

8. Paper 2005, PREDICTING FECAL COLIFORM BACTERIA LEVELS IN THE CHARLES RIVER, MASSACHUSETTS, USA, https://sites.tufts.edu/richardvogel/files/2019/04/bacteria-charles-river.pdf ,fecal coliform bacteria death rate is impacted by both solar radiance and water temperature. Salinity. They also deter- mined that transport, dilution, dispersion, and concentrations of fecal coliform are strongly influenced by the timing, spatial distribution, and amount of rainfall, runoff, and streamflow and that light penetration, which is reduced by turbidity, is the most important factor in determining decay rates. Young and Thackston (1999) found that fecal bacteria counts in urban tributaries were much higher in sewered basins than in nonsewered basins and in general were related to housing density, population, development, percent impervious area, and domestic animal density. Mallin et al. (2000) found that fecal coliform densities were strongly correlated with turbidity (positively) and salinity (negatively). Features include rainfall, seasonality, solar radiation intensity, sky cover, wind speed, streamflow, etc.
