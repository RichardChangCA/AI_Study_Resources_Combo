2. Medium, Deep Learning in Histopathology (Part I), https://medium.com/swlh/deep-learning-in-histopathology-c104478c00cd LSTMs and Conditional Random Fields are increasingly being used in combination with CNNs to model the correlation between neighboring patches, in order to capture larger contextual information. Graph structure is highly memory-efficent. Unsupervised learning help us learn useful patterns and representation from the data when we donâ€™t have labels for the data.
