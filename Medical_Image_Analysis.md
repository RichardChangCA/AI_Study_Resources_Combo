1. Medium, MONAI framework is a PyTorch-based open-source foundation for deep learning in healthcare imaging, https://monai.medium.com/monai-releases-v0-5-f3cc1f29592a ,GitHub: https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI ,Documents: https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/highlights.html#monai-architecture 

2. Medium, Deep Learning in Histopathology (Part I), https://medium.com/swlh/deep-learning-in-histopathology-c104478c00cd LSTMs and Conditional Random Fields are increasingly being used in combination with CNNs to model the correlation between neighboring patches, in order to capture larger contextual information. Graph structure is highly memory-efficent. Unsupervised learning help us learn useful patterns and representation from the data when we don’t have labels for the data.

6. The problem of ANDI dataset, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): ADNI  targets  mild  cognitive  impairment  and  ADand, by design, includes a limited number of older adults without dementia and no individuals before middle age. ADNI is a multicenter study thatwill be extremely valuable for developing methods thatcan pool across sites.
