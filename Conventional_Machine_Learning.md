6. Medium, Rediscovering Semi-Supervised Learning(SSL), https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/re-discovering-semi-supervised-learning-a18bb46116e3 ,use unsupervised method to cluster unlabeled data with labeled data and give unlabeled data with pseudo-label with certain proportion ratio(pseudo-label=ratio*true-label) or uncertainty-based(pseudo-label>threshold denoted as true label, this method is better). give low weight(according to confidence value) on pseudo-label data and more more weight on true-labeled data(no significant difference). And then use supervised learning method with true-labeled data augmentation.
