R is often used for statistical computing and graphical presentation to analyze and visualize data.

paste(): concatenate, or join, two or more elements, uses comma(,), cannot combine a string and a number, merge two strings

Type conversion: as.numeric(), as.integer(), as.complex()

Math: ceiling(), floor(), abs()

cat() function for the string: line breaks to be inserted at the same position as in the code.

nchar() function to find the number of characters in a string.

grepl() function to check if a character or a sequence of characters are present in a string

Arithmetic operator %% : Modulus(Remainder from division) or Integer Division.

x <- 1 or 1 -> x , both of them work

R Miscellaneous Operators:
: Creates s series of numbers in a sequence x <- 1:10
%in% Find out if an element belongs to a vector x %in% y
%*% Matrix Multiplication x <- Matrix1 %*% Matrix2

next statement: skip n iteration without terminating the loop(similar as continue for other programming languages)

Global variables: variables that are created outside of a function. can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside. Operator: <<-

Vectors: c() function, separate the items by a comma. length() to calculate vector length, negative index numbers to access all items except the ones specified.

rep(): repeat vectors for each value, repeat the sequence of the vector, repeat each value independently

seq(): to make bigger or smaller steps in a sequence for generating sequenced vectors, from, to, by.

list(): A list in R can contain many different data types insdie it, a list is a collection of data which is ordered and changeable.

cbind() function to add additional columns in a Matrix, rbind() for rows, can also combine two matrices

dim() function to find the amount of rows and columns in a Matrix

arrays can have more than two dimensions, arrays can only have one data type

data.frame() are data displayed in a format as a table, data frames can have different types of data inside it, but each column should have the same type of data. summary(0 function to summarize the data from a data frame. 

facors() are used to categorize data, levels() is the set of factors

multiple lines: plot() together with lines()

To compare the plot with another plot, use the points() function

which.max(), which.min() functions to find the index position of the max and min value in the table
