4. Medium, A Brief Introduction to Markov Chains, https://medium.com/sigmoid/rl-markov-chains-dbf2f37e8b69 , A Markov Chain is a stochastic(always changing) model that is used to estimate the outcome of an event given only the previous state and its action. Markov Reward Process where the agent(whose objective is to maximize the rewards earned in the task) in the current task is rewarded based on its performance in the current time step.
